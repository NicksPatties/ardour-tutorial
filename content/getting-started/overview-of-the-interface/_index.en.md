We will take a look at shared elements of the interface, main windows, and focus on the _Editor_ window and the _Mixer_ window. Later chapters will give more detailed information on each feature listed here.

### Clocks

![Clocks](en/Ardour6_Clocks.png)
 
The main **Clocks** are located next to the transport controls. Clocks
in Ardour can display time in 4 different formats: Time Code,
Bars:Beats, Minutes:Seconds, and Samples. Right-click on the clock to
select a format. You can also turn the clock off. The reason for having
two transport clocks is that it allows you to see the playhead position
in two different time units without having to change any settings.

Please see the [**Setting Up the Timeline**](../setting-up-the-timeline) chapter for more details on the
Clocks.

You can use the key combination **Alt + M** (**Control + M** on a
