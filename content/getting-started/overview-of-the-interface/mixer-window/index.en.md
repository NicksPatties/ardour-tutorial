The main function of the Mixer Window is to display all the Mixer Strips
for the various Tracks side by side for easy reference. This window is
mainly used during the **Mixing** process, and it also provides access
**Plugins** and other **Routing** features. See the chapters on
**Understanding Routing**, **Mixing** and **Using Plugins** for details.

This window also contains a listing of the available Mixer Strips in the
upper left hand corner. The check boxes in this area can be used to view
and hide the Mixer Strips of the different Tracks. Finally, there is an
area for managing **Groups**.
