There are a couple of resources on the Internet to help you learn Ardour and
fix some of the problems that you might have along the way.

## Ardour Manual

The official [Ardour Manual](http://manual.ardour.org/) is the main reference to Ardour. It is a work in progress, meaning you will not find every single feature explained there (yet). But it is already an amazing resource:

## Getting Help via Chat

A good way to get support when learning Ardour and working with it is using the
**Chat** function. Ardour has a built-in "Chat" option, found in the main menu
under `Help > Chat` to connect (via your web browser) to the Ardour
[IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) channel at libera.chat.

You could also use your IRC-capable chat application (like Pidgin or Xchat) to
connect to the Ardour channel (\#ardour or \#ardour-osx) at the libera.chat
network, or use this weblink directly:

[https://web.libera.chat//#ardour](https://web.libera.chat//#ardour)

Enter a nickname and connect, you are welcome!

In such a IRC Chat channel or room, you find the Ardour developers and other
users to chat about using Ardour, problems and/or bugs you are facing, or about
suggestions for Ardour which you want to discuss.

## Getting Help via Mailing Lists

For those that prefer mailing lists to IRC chatting, the [Ardour
Users](http://lists.ardour.org/listinfo.cgi/ardour-users-ardour.org%20) mailing
list is also a good place where users and some developers discuss all kinds of
problems and ideas related to using Ardour. This is an active list, with many
helpful and knowledgeable users around to help guide less experienced people.
There are sometimes more general discussions about topics like recording
technique, audio interface selection, etc.

## Getting Help via Forum

The Ardour team also maintains an active [forum](https://discourse.ardour.org/)
where you can ask for help, discuss bugs and feature requests, and post your
music composed, recorded, arranged, and mixed with Ardour.
