# Ardour Tutorial

This is a crash course into [Ardour](https://ardour.org), a free/libre digital
audio workstation.

The content was originally written around in 2009 during a Book Sprint led by
Derek Holzer for [FLOSS Manuals](http://archive.flossmanuals.net/ardour/). It
was later updated by multiple contributors and maintained by Bruno Ruviaro.

All credits are on the
[Credits](https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/credits/)
page.

This updated version is technically a port from Jekyll to Hugo and content-wise
mostly an update to match many changes between Ardour v4/v6 and v7.0 plus some
new material. The intention is to make it the official Ardour tutorial for
beginners and maintain it as part of the upstream project.
